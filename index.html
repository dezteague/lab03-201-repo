        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the <em>University of Washington</em> in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in Communication and a minor in Diversity.  During my time there, I had the opportunity to study abroad which fueled my love for travel!  My first study abroad trip was to <em>Buenos Aires, Argentina</em> in 2010.  I also studied in the northeastern state of Bahia, Brazil in the spring of 2011.</p>

        <h2>Work & Travel Experience</h2>
        <p>In 2013, I moved to Heredia, Costa Rica to complete my certification in <em>Teaching English as a Foreign Language</em> (TEFL).  Since then, I have taught English to students ranging from preschoolers to retired adults!  Teaching allowed me to live and work in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Spain, and Australia. These experiences taught me resourcefulness, adaptability, and interpersonal communication.</p>
